Identify what you want to change and break it down in to tiny behaviors and put them in the right spark.The right spark is already a habit you are doing everyday, this allows us to grow.

## 2.How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P

B = MAP model developed by Dr.B.J.Fogg, where B - Behavior, M - Motivation, A - Ability, P - Prompt.

- Motivation plays key role in making new habit easier. If we want to perform any action or behavior the key is to be motivated to start the action.
- Ability is nothing but the level of difficulty to perform a habit. If the behavior or habit is easy it will be done easy. Firstly we have to break the habit into small steps to perform effectively.
- Prompt is like a reminder to perform certain habit which we decided to perform. For this we can keep alarm or reminders and to become easier we can keep the things nearby to perform certain habits.

## 3.Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

Celebrating after habit completion reinforces the behavior positively, boosts motivation, and strengthens the habit loop, enhancing long-term adherence and goal achievement.

## 4.What was the most interesting story or idea for you?
